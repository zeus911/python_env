Description: # Overview
        
        Jondis is a high availability pool management class for the excellent https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py
        
        # Features
        
        * Slave discovery on startup
        * On master failure, if a slave is promoted, the pool will reconfigure to connect to the new master
        
        
        # Limitations
        
        * Currently all commands are sent to the master
        * No master discovery if only a slave server is provided
        * In certain scenarios, the pool will pick up new slaves (if it's reconfigured), but
          there's currently no periodic / automatic slave discovery
        * Does not talk to sentinel
        
        
        # Requirements
        
        redis-py
        
        
        # Usage
        
        In order to configure the pool, you'll need to provide at least 1 active master server.  This is a limitation that
        will be lifted soon with master discovery.
        
        ```python
        from jondis.pool import Pool
        pool = Pool(hosts=["redis01:6379","redis02:6379"])
        redis = redis_lib.client.StrictRedis(connection_pool=pool)
        ```
